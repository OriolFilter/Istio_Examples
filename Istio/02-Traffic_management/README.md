# Examples

(almost) ALL NEEDS DOCUMENTATION / REVIEW

- 01-2_deployments_method
- 02-DirectResponse-HTTP-Body
- 03-HTTPRewrite
- 04-HTTPRedirect
- 05a-FaultInjection-delay
- 05b-FaultInjection-abort
- 06-mTLS  (would need some documentation review, mainly go over the differences respective to the template/prior configuration used)
- 07-HTTPS-Gateway-Simple-TLS   <- Doesn't respect the changelog format.
- 08a-HTTPS-min-TLS-version
- 08b-HTTPS-max-TLS-version
- 09-HTTPS-backend
- 10-TCP-FORWARDING
- 11-TLS-PASSTHROUGH
- 12-HTTP-to-HTTPS-traffic-redirect    -> Documented.  



This will need some reorganization.
